Recall: A blackbody is 
Dependent on the wavelength, frequency, the speed of light, the Planck constant, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and temperature. 
Temperature is the only variable as everything else in the equation is constant!
Where most light comes out of EM spectrum depends on the temperature, we see visible light because of the sun's temperature, 5000K 
We only see each other because of the sun's reflected light, can't see our emitted light because we emit infrared due to our ~300K temperature
Observed at 870 x 10^-6 m wavelength, B(nu) is 1.25 x 10^-12 cgs, look up h, c, k in cgs units. Need to solve for T, find its root!! 
0 = (2hnu^3 / c^2) / (e^(hnu / kT) - 1)
The temperature will be 42K ;)
