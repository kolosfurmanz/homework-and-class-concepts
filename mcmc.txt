1. Assign numbers to objects/cities
2. Decide on ordering cities
3. Figure out distance using distance equation 
4. use MCMC methods to figure out the best order that makes the total distance a minimum by first swapping 2 of the objects. If it's better, keep it and switch another 2 to see if that's even better. 
*Sometimes, it's best to keep somewhat of a worse answer to avoid accepting the local minimum as the global minimum, annealling!!
